MijoShop-Language-Tool
======================

Quickly copy products, categories and more to an new language

Make sure to backup your site before using this tool..

This component does te following:

It creates language records for all your exisiting products, 
categories, options, attributes, banner images and information in MijoShop.

You can select which source language items you want to use to create the new items.

Example:

let's say your shop has 100 products with english descriptions and you've already manually translated 40 products in dutch.
And assume the id for the english language is 1 and for dutch it is 2

using this tool the other 60 products can be added in the dutch views 
(products not haveing a dutch description won't show up in a dutch view)

And if you add another language, let's say German and it's id = 3

You can either use the 100 products with language id 1 or the 40 products with language id 2 to create new items with language id 3

It won't override the already translated items, but be sure to make a backup just to be sure!
